# MindSpace

Mental health is a major concern worldwide and India is not far behind in sharing this. If we evaluate developments in the field of mental health, 
the pace appears to be slow. According to a recent National Mental Health Survey, approximately 150 million people in India need care for their mental
health condition.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about mental health and substance use have grown,including concerns about suicidal ideation. During these times, 
when maintaining your mental health has become so important, talking to a professional Therapist or Consultant can help people cope with a wide range of 
experiences.

MindSpace is a web-based application that provides people with a platform to seek professional help and guidance. MindSpace is built for people who are fighting their mental health battles alone. It aims to bridge
the gap between Indian society and the stigma surrounding mental health.
