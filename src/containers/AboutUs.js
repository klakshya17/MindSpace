        <h3>
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about mental health and
          substance use have grown, including concerns about suicidal ideation.
          During these times, when maintaining your mental health has become so
          important, talking to a professional Therapist or Consultant can help
          people cope with a wide range of experiences.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We aim to improve the mental health of all people in India, to help
          individuals lift themselves out of the impacts of poor mental health.
          We seek to ensure that all people, especially those with the fewest
          resources hold a good state of mental health to secure opportunities
          to help themselves.
